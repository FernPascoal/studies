##What is Flutter?

Flutter is a Google's framework that allows us to build native cross-platform apps with one programming language (Dart, also from google) and codebase.

##Why to use Flutter instead of other cross-platforms?

Unlike **React Native**, Flutter really RUNS the application, it doesn't just make requests to the mobile native components, so it doesn't need to use a 'bridge' (middleware).

The Flutter application runs on a canvas, so it's not a webview like used in **Ionic**.

Flutter's **Hot Reload** allows us to view modifications almost instantly, so we could review UI more efficiently.
